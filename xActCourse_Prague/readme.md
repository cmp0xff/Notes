### The xAct project

### Sylabus

### Sample session in xTensor

### Working with coordinates

### Working with exterior calculus

### Basic operations

### Cartan structure equations

# Lecture 2

## Introduction to the Wolfram Language


## Basic elements of the Wolfram Language (WL)
Everyting in the WL is an expression.
### Summary and Exiercises


## Evaluation principles of the Wolfram Language
Expressions are evaluated using definitions until they no longer change.
### Summary and Exercises


## Performing definitions in the Wolfram Language
Ownvalues, Downvalues, Upvalues, etc.
### Summary and Exercises


## Pattern matching in the Wolfram Language
They can be regarded as a variable representing an expression. They enable the
recognition of expressions.
### Most common patterns
`Blank`, `BlankSequence`, `BlankNullSequence`
### Summary and Exercises


## Assining values in the Wolfram Language
### Values can be assigned in two ways
Delayed or non-delayed assignments

### Delayed assignments

### Non delayed assignments

### Summary and Exercises


## Working with expressions in the WL
### Two ways to work with an expression
Operate with the complete or subsets / parts of the expression

### Symmary and Exercises

## Pure functions in the WL
### Two ways of introducing a function
Downvalues, upvalues; purefunction, Lambda-function.
